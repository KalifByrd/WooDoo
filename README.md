# WooDoo: A Cozy Magical Town-Building Life Simulation Game

Welcome to **WooDoo**, a charming life simulation game where you create your own magical town and build meaningful relationships with unique inhabitants known as the Star Folk.

## üéÆ **Concept**

In WooDoo, you start your new life by creating a custom character and venturing into diverse islands. Along the way, you will meet the Star Folk‚Äîeach with their own personality and charm.
